There are three steps in bdcnv. The first step is to use "extractfeatures.Py" to extract the features of BAM files. The second step is to use "prediction.Py" to predict the extracted features. The third step is to use "mybds.Py" get the final result.
Use config Ini to configure parameters.

"ExtractFeatures.Py" file uses the parameters under "[extractfeatures]", "bamfilepath" is the path of BAM file, 
"chrfile" is the path of the corresponding reference fasta file, "binlen" is the bin length, cnvbd method uses 1500 length by default,
 "dc" is a parameter related to sequencing depth. When the extracted DS features are all 1, please increase the size of this parameter 
appropriately, and the default is 0.5.

"prediction.Py" file uses the parameters under "[prediction]", "predictionfilepath" is the path of the file generated by the feature extraction in the previous step, 
which is the data used for prediction,"binlen" is the bin length, cnvbd method uses 1500 length by default, "model" is the model used for prediction.

"myBDS.Py" file uses the parameters under "[bds]", "predictionresultfile" is the result of the second step model prediction, "bamfilepath" is the path of BAM file,
 "chrfile" is the path of the corresponding reference fasta file, "binlen" is the bin length, and cnvbd method uses 1500 length by default.

The final result of bdcnv is a TXT file ending in "_result_border.txt".
